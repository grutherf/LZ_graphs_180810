Installation Instructions:

1. Make empty build and install directories either inside or outside the NEST source code directory, and go to the build directory.
	For example, from the source code directory: 

	>> mkdir build; mkdir install; cd build

2. In the new build directory, configure CMake. On systems where the C compiler/C++ compiler 
paths are already specified, one can simply do:

	>> cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${PWD}/../install/ ../relative/path/NobleElementSimulationTechnique

If the compiler paths cannot be found (for example, on some cluster environments), one should do:

	>> cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER="/path/to/bin/gcc" -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER="/path/to/bin/g++" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${PWD} ../relative/path/NobleElementSimulationTechnique

3. To build the source code into a library and generate the testNEST executable:
	
	>> make; make install

4. The compiled testNEST executable and libraries, and all the headers, are now present in the install directory. 
Also present in the install directory are cmake configuration files. You may use these to include NEST in cmake-configured
projects by including in your projects' CMakeLists.txt:
        find_package(NEST REQUIRED)
        include_directories(${NEST_INCLUDE_DIRS})
and running cmake on your projects with the flag:
        -DNEST_DIR=[path to NEST install directory]

5. After changes to the source code, one should do a clean make for good measure:

	>> make clean; make; make install


testNEST run Instructions:

This program takes 6 (or 7) inputs, with Z position in mm from bottom of detector:
	./testNEST numEvts type_interaction E_min[keV] E_max[keV] field_drift[V/cm] x,y,z-position[mm] {optional:seed}

For 8B, numEvts (integer) is replaced with kg-days of exposure (floating-point #) with all other input parameters the same (unchanged). For WIMPs:
	./testNEST exposure[kg-days] {WIMP} m[GeV] x-sect[cm^2] field_drift[V/cm] x,y,z-position[mm] {optional:seed}

For cosmic-ray muons or other similar particles with elongated track lengths:
	./testNEST numEvts {MIP} LET[MeV*cm^2/gram] x,y-position[mm](Initial) field_drift[V/cm] x,y,z-position[mm](Final) {optional:seed}

NOTES:
	- If you want to use the default drift field from detector settings, put -1 as the argument for field_drift.
	- If you want to randomly distribute events in space, rather than specify a point source, put -1 as the argument for x,y,z. -1 for seed > time-based rand seed

	- If you want to use the ROOT tools provided (and have ROOT installed already on your machine of course!) then to compile
	g++ -g -Wno-c++11-extensions -Wno-deprecated-declarations -Ofast -o rootNEST `root-config --cflags --libs` rootNEST.cpp
	Wno-... flag is optional, gets rid of annoying warning that's ROOT's fault not you. Ofast optional too, for speed. Might be -O3 on your machine.
	You can now also use #define FIT mode with rootNEST to fit a band. Example XENON10 band files courtesy of Luiz de Viveiros are included in the 6-column format:
	Bin Center  Bin Actual  Gaus Mean  Mean Error  Gaus Sigma  Sig Error  (in files Xe10_ERBand_Luiz.txt and Xe10_NRBand_Luiz.txt).
	With #define LIMIT, you can start calculating an exclusion curve, by first providing an efficiency curve (arXiv:1512.03506 provided as an example <- LUX Run03)
	
	- NuisParam is available to change the mean light and charge yields of nuclear recoils (separately) as E-independent multiplicative factors
